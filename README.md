# Brain Tumor Classification using CNN & Flask

This project is a Brain Tumor Classification system developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and deployed using Flask as a web application.  
Users can upload an MRI image and the system predicts the type of brain tumor.


##  Features
- CNN-based Brain Tumor Classification
- MRI image upload and prediction
- Flask web interface
- Train model locally
- Test images without retraining
- Works on CPU and GPU
- Simple UI for students and mini projects



##  Technologies Used
- Python 3.9
- TensorFlow 2.9.1
- Keras
- Flask
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- HTML & CSS
- VS Code

##  Dataset

The dataset contains MRI images categorized into different brain tumor classes.

Example folder structure:

dataset/
├── Training/
│   ├── glioma/
│   ├── meningioma/
│   ├── pituitary/
│   └── notumor/
└── Testing/
    ├── glioma/
    ├── meningioma/
    ├── pituitary/
    └── notumor/

Dataset source:
- Kaggle – Brain Tumor MRI Dataset



##  Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Brain_Tumor_Project.git  
cd Brain_Tumor_Project

2. Create virtual environment

python -m venv venv  
venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies

pip install tensorflow==2.9.1 flask opencv-python numpy matplotlib pillow scikit-learn



##  Train the Model

python main.py  

Choose:
1 → Train Model

This will generate:
- Brain_Tumors.h5
- class_names.npy



##  Test Image (Without Training)

python main.py  

Choose:
2 → Test Image

Enter the image path when prompted.


##  Run Flask Web Application

python app.py  

Open browser and go to:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Upload MRI image and get prediction result.

##  Important Notes
- Brain_Tumors.h5 is not uploaded to GitHub due to size limit
- Dataset is ignored in GitHub
- Train the model locally before testing
